                    When you invest your money with us, we use 20% of the funds for high frequency trading in the stock market. The remaining 80% is kept as a safety net in case of any losses and used for much safer investments. However, we'll ensure that the minimum value of your funds will always be close to 80% of the initial investment. Profits made using your investment will be added to your account on a monthly basis.

                    High volatility trading can be risky, which is why we only trade with 20% of the funds. This primarily includes trading in futures and options. The remaining 80% is used for relatively safer investments and to keep your funds secure. We aim to provide you with consistent returns on your investments, but please remember that all investments carry inherent risk.

                    We have mentioned in our FAQs that we charge a 20% commission on the profits made. This is to cover the costs of trading, maintaining the dashboard, and providing you with regular updates on your portfolio. We only make money when you make money, since the 20% is part of the profits and not the entire investment. We do not charge any fees if you do not make a profit.

                    We have a lock-in period of 3 months. This ensures that we can provide you with the best returns possible. If you wish to withdraw your investment before the lock-in period, you will be charged a 20% penalty on the total investment amount or on the current value of your investment, whichever is higher.
