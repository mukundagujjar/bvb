            <h2 className="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors">Agency Information</h2><br />
            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Management and Responsibility</h3><br />
            Bulls v/s Bears is managed solely by an individual named Vasudev Kittur, also known as Anurodh Kittur. Any responsibility pertaining to the workings of this agency depends on him. We are not SEBI registered and are not affiliated with any other organization. You should invest your money wisely and understand the risks involved.<br /><br />

            <h2 className="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors">Investment Terms</h2><br />
            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Investment Risk Disclosure</h3><br />
            Investments are subject to market risk. You should be financially responsible and should invest amounts based on your own discretion and research. While we guarantee a minimum of 8% monthly returns on your total investment amount, all investments inherently carry some level of risk. Past performance is not indicative of future results.<br /><br />

            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Investment Lock-in Period</h3><br />
            We recommend a lock-in period of 3 months from the date of investment to ensure optimal returns. After this 3-month period, you may withdraw your investment value as per your requirement. The current value will include your secure 80% plus any profits generated. If you need to withdraw before the 3-month period, you will only receive the 80% secure portion of your investment. The 20% risk capital will be retained as it is committed to ongoing trading activities.<br /><br />

            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Risk Allocation</h3><br />
            Of the amount invested, 20% should be considered as risk capital that will be used for active trading including but not limited to Indian futures and options, Forex, and other similar instruments. This 20% will be used in perpetuity to generate profits. We guarantee that regardless of market conditions, your account will always maintain at least 80% of your original investment amount. We take full responsibility for ensuring this secure capital remains protected.<br /><br />

            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Returns and Commission</h3><br />
            We guarantee a minimum of 8% profit per month calculated on your total investment amount. Our commission is 5% of the profits generated - not on your total investment. This means we only make money when you make money. In cases where we exceed the 8% monthly return, our 5% commission applies to the total profits generated.<br /><br />

            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Payment Methods</h3><br />
            Payments will be made directly to Vasudev Kittur/Anurodh Kittur. In the future, we may implement direct payment methods through our website, at which time these Terms will be updated accordingly.<br /><br />

            <h2 className="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors">Accounts</h2><br />
            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Account Eligibility</h3><br />
            We maintain the right to reject any investment applications or terminate your account from our platform at our sole discretion. We may require verification of identity and other information before accepting investments.<br /><br />

            <h3 className="scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Account Termination</h3><br />
            If your account is terminated by us, the balance mapped to your account will be paid back to you within a reasonable time frame, usually within 30 business days, depending on market conditions and liquidity of investments.<br /><br />

            <h2 className="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors">Limitation of Liability</h2><br />
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Bulls v/s Bears, its managers, agents, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages, or any damages whatsoever including, without limitation, damages for loss of use, data, or profits, arising out of or in any way connected with the use or performance of the Service.<br /><br />

            <h2 className="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors">Governing Law</h2><br />

            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.<br /><br />

            <h2 className="scroll-m-20 border-b pb-2 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight transition-colors">Changes to Terms</h2><br />
            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.<br /><br />

            By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.<br /><br />
